# Sav Keep

Clone of Google Keep made with Vue 3 Composition API and FireBase

## Usage

Create a `.env.local` file at the root path and enter your firebase project creds:

```
VITE_FB_API_KEY=
VITE_FB_AUTH_DOMAIN=
VITE_FB_PROJECT_ID=
VITE_FB_STORAGE_BUCKET=
VITE_FB_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
VITE_FB_APP_ID=
VITE_FB_MEASUREMENT_ID=
```

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Headed Component Tests with [Cypress Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/component)

```sh
npm run test:unit:dev # or `npm run test:unit` for headless testing
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
